# Get_Vicki
A simple  imitation of a popular game *Catch the crazy cat*.

##Game Rules:

1. There will be some random orange dots and one blue dot generated on a 9 by 9 matrix. Orange dots represent walls and blue dot represents the target "Vicki".

2. Each step you can point any one gray dot to become an orange one to block the way and to try to surround Vicki. And Vicki will move one dot away from its current position.

3. The Game will end once you surround Vicki, which means there is no way out, or Vicki escaped.
